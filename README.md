# Marketing Agency:  Horiseon

For this project, I was asked to refactor the current code for the Marketing Agency "Horiseon".

The goal is to make sure the websitse follows web accessiblity standards and processes in the optamization of for search engines.  We believe once these processes are complete, it will improve the business exposure.  At the same time,  the business needs to make sure that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to the website and make sure they avoid any type of ligitation.

Process to follow:
1. Follow the Scout Rule
2. Improve codebase
3. Site functionality
4. CSS consolidation, efficient coding CSS selectors and properties
5. Follow semantic structure



Currently the URL for Horiseon is as follow:

The Following is the list of the changes implemented to the code:
